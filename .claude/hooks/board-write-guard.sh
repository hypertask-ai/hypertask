# PreToolUse guard (Valentin, 2026-09-15, HARD RULE): sessions never touch the Hypertask board by hand.
# Board writes come only from the runner (agent-board-poll) and the supervisor (ht-supervisor), which run as
# systemd timers outside any session. A session fixes the mechanism and runs it (ht-supervisor --now).
# Override only when Valentin says so in chat: touch /tmp/ht-board-write-approved (remove it when done).
#
# This copy is a reference, not an active gate. A hook only runs when a settings
# file registers it, and nothing in this repo does; the live registration is in
# ~/.claude/settings.json and points at the copy in ~/.claude/hooks. It is kept
# here so the rule travels with the repo and so a host that wants it can point
# its own settings at this path.
#
# It does not, and cannot, stop the fleet working tickets. agent-board-poll and
# ht-supervisor are systemd timers, not Claude Code sessions, so no PreToolUse
# hook sees them. An agent claiming a ticket, commenting on it, or recording a
# QA verdict goes through its runner and is unaffected.

## Agent board scope guard (HTPR-7496)

`ci-tests` runs `.github/scripts/agent-scope/run.py --self-test` and then the real
scan after dependency installation or cache restore, before Prisma generation.
Python 3.12 from the runner tool cache (asserted, so an image change fails loudly)
creates a venv in `RUNNER_TEMP`; pip requires the committed hashes for Semgrep 1.140.0 and Pydantic
2.11.9. Pip downloads are cached, metrics and version checks are disabled.

The inventory is regenerated every run. Coverage is direct `prisma.project/task/comment`
findMany/findFirst/findUnique/update/delete/count calls in agent-capable entry files
only (files without such a delegate are skipped before Semgrep), not transitive controllers or whole-program authorization proof. Strict parse
errors and unscanned targets fail. Source-bound reviewed exceptions are separate
from visible, expiring call-bound debt. New findings and stale entries fail.

On PRs, additions or changes to existing debt/exception lists require each entry's
full `approvedIn` ticket URL and the matching PR body line, respectively
`Agent scope debt approved: <URL>` or `Agent scope exception approved: <URL>`.
First creation and removals are free. See [the guard README](../.github/scripts/agent-scope/README.md).
This adds no job, required check or ruleset change. Today's 81 debt entries are
tracked in https://app.hypertask.ai/detail/project-15/7508.

## Performance baseline

On 2026-08-08, ten recent PR runs showed successful CI Build jobs taking 5:57–7:11, with a 6:48 median. Dependency installation took 100–152 seconds and full lint took 116–130 seconds.

The cache prototype for https://app.hypertask.ai/detail/project-15/5191 completed deterministic installation in 64.7 seconds locally. Full lint took 114.6 seconds cold and 3.47 seconds warm. A deliberate syntax-error probe still failed on the warm content cache, confirming changed files are not hidden.

The first Contabo run completed cold in 6:02. Repeating the exact commit on the same runner completed in 3:45: install took 55 seconds, TypeScript 74 seconds, lint 4 seconds, and tests 35 seconds. Restoring the separate setup-node npm archive cost 32 seconds, so that redundant remote cache was removed in favour of the persistent runner-local npm cache. A later run on a different runner exposed ESLint's absolute cache paths; the workflow now relocates those paths before linting.

Keep this file, [`docs/ci-policy.yml`](ci-policy.yml), and [https://hypertask.app/pipeline](https://hypertask.app/pipeline) synchronized with the live workflows.
